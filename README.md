## Fast Bit\-shifting Class Demo \(Update\)

### Description

Fast Bit-shifting Class Demo (Update + ASM files)by Robert Rayment. Thanks to David Fritts for highlighting this method on PSC (CodeId=45885). I've corrected the assembler and Ulli has recast it in his own inimitable style with some explanations. In fact the method is the self-same as that used by Dmitry (CodeId=11830) a few years ago. The main point is that, when comparing fast EXEs, this bitshifting class is over 10 times quicker than the standard VB way using functions of the form 2^p. This description is extended in Notes.txt.
